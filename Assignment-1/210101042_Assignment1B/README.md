## File Structure

I have written my code in `Visual Basic`, as instructed by sir, and hence submitted a project named `quadratic-equation-solver` with a `.vb` file, named `210101042_Assignment1B.vb`.

To find the required files, one needs to open the `quadratic-equation-solver` folder, which contains another folder named `quadratic-equation-solver`, this folder is our `solution` and contains `210101042_Assignment1B.vb`.

## Running the program

Opening the project in `Visual Studio 2010` renders this:

One needs to click the green button on the left of the `Debug` dropdown list in order to build and run the solution.

## Input structure

1. `a`, `b`, `c` should be `INTEGERS` ranging from `-1000` to `1000` both sides INCLUSIVE.
2. `a` can't be zero.

Click on `Calculate roots!` button to actually calculate the roots of the quadratic equation solver.
